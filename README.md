# music21playground

Some Jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/) to test basic music21 functionalities.

### Run notebook online
There are some possibilities to get an interactive online notebook running without the need to install the whole jNotebook environment. Especially useful for classes, e-learning etc.

Binder:
https://mybinder.org/

Google Notebooks:

To see this Repo running on Binder, click on the badge:

Basic functionalities are interactively working with the Binder image. Unfortunately, for now museScore can't be embedded in the Binder image in a way that the ".show()"-method from music21 is displaying any notes.
